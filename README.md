# vanilla-webpack-boilerplate
For writing passionate Javascript.

Boilerplate that builds and minimizes a vanilla CSS / JS project. Great for plugins and libraries! 

## Instructions

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a live-server for editing.

## To build

```sh
npm build
```

This will generate a file called bundle.js in the /dist folder that includes the css and js. 

## A simple deployment on GitHub

Click "Use This Template" and create a new project. 

Clone the project, make your changes. 

Run

```sh
npm build
```

In Github go to settings/pages in the project and select deploy from branch. 

Link to /dist/bundle.js on the published pages. This will load the CSS and JS.
